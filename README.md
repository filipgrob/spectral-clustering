# spectral-clustering
This code was developed as homework in the course of Computational Linear Algebra for Large Scale Problems. It contains a MATLAB implementation of the spectral clustering algorithm. We provide a series of 2D and 3D common benchmarks for the clustering problem. They can be accessed in the 2D and 3D folders. This project was done in group with Sergio Augusto Angelini and Vittorio Gallo.
